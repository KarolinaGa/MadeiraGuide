The Laurisilva of Madeira is a relict of a previously widespread laurel forest, and that is why it's on the UNESCO&#160;list of world heritage sites. It is the largest surviving area of laurel forest and is believed to be 90% primary forest. It contains a unique suite of plants and animals, including many endemic species such as the Madeira long-toed pigeon.</p>
