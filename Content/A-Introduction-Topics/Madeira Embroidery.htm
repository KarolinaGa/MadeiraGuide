        <p>This art of embroidery has been passed down from generation to generation. Each piece of Madeira embroidery  is made with impressive skill and attention to detail using materials like linen, natural silk and cotton. The authenticity of each piece is certified with the guarantee seal of the Madeira Wine, Embroidery and Handicrafts Institute. You can purchase an embroidered tablecloth or a piece of clothing at Bordal – Bordados da Madeira, located in Funchal.</p>
